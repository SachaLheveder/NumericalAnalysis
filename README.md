Numerical Analysis is a repository where I am storing my assignments from MATH 317, a numerical analysis class I took as an elective last year.
The files are .ipynb because I used jupyter notebooks to write the code and markdown sections. The code is in python, which I taught myself as I took the course.
Some of the answers may contain silly mistakes.
